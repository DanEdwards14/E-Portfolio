I'm a soon to be Graduate of The University of Alabama. I'm working towards my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, with a minor in both Math and Computer Science. I'm also a member of the University Honors Program.I'm currently planning to work at Revere Control Systems after I graduate as a Project Engineer I. I have experience with programming in C, C++, VHDL, and Verilog (and slightly less experience with many other languages). Once I begin working I will be mainly programming with general Ladder Logic systems such as RSLogix and Factory Talk Services. I participated at Revere as a Co-Op student for 3 semesters getting experience with these tools as well as hands on experience as a Controls Systems Engineer. During my time at UA as an Undergrad, I developed a functioning FPGA Framebuffer designed to work with a hyperRAM chip and a small camera. I also worked with Dr. Nathan Jeong in his lab developing a Linear Antenna Array system that uses Microwave Imaging to scan and reconstruct a 2D image of any object, as well as locate potential foreign objects inside containers such as jars and bottles.

My main philosophy in life is that with a proper mindset anything is possible, and I bring this ideal into my personal, academic, and work life. In my free time I enjoy lifting weights at the gym, playing with my dog, working on digital art, and working on personal projects. Some stuff I'm most interested in is creating unique apps for phones and smart watches, Alexa scripts, and finding ways to add digital art into my projects. I hope to one day get my Master's in Embedded Systems, as the embedded systems labs were some of my favorite projects to tackle and where I owe most of my engineering and programming talent to.
